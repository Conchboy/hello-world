# Journey to CS savvy
### needs of understanding codes and being programming savvy when dealing with the Ind. 4.0 topic in the factory
### with material science background, it is pretty difficult for me to grasp the key of those logics
### I ever learnt Basic, Pascal and C in the school time. I did quite good in the learning;
### quite a lot new stuffs related to the network and the protocols totally new to me..
### I decided to learn C and Python in order to be able to know what happens in the coding..
### help my colleagues to solve their headache on the data cleasing and analysis etc.. 
### as a guy born in 70s', it is a good challenge to catch up the up to date progress of the CS, network, internet and mobile communication etc.. 
### good luck to me!
